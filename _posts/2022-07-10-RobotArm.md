Status : Currently in progress

As a tinkerer of software and hardware, I enjoy dabling in electronics and microcontrollers.
Mainly sticking to arduino for this project, but looking to pivot into ESP32 or other brands to 
expand my portfolio.

Embedded systems development is a career I have considered entering and so here is my first foray into
it. I will be basing this project on another persons designs which you can find  <a href='https://www.instructables.com/EEZYbotARM/'> the original designers of course.</a>

Of course, mine will look different due to 3d printer PLA colours being different and the mechanism used to control it being different as well. The below figures are images of the build itself in various stages.

Concerns:
Some of the initial concerns I had for this project was that :

1. Getting the 3d printed parts.
2. Trying to get the required screws/nuts/bolts at a good price and delivered on time.
3. Trying to add a controller to the arm, diffent to the initial design.
4. Enough time to actually complete the build.
5. File down plastic so that the motors turn.

So far, only concern 3. & 4. is an issue at this point. As I need to aquire/make and then
program a controller for this arm and still find the time to complete the thing.
