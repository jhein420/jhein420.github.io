As a tinkerer of software and hardware, I enjoy dabling in electronics and microcontrollers.
Mainly sticking to arduino for this project, but looking to pivot into ESP32 or other brands to 
expand my portfolio.

Embedded systems development is a career I have considered entering and so here is my first foray into
it. I will be basing this project on another persons designs which you can find here at https://www.instructables.com/EEZYbotARM/ (Credit to the original designers of course).

Of course, mine will look different due to 3d printer PLA colours being different and the mechanism used to control it being different as well.
