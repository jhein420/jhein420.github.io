I recently decided to modernize my knowledge of php web development by trying out the
Symfony PHP framework along with the doctrine ORM tools. This will be a challenge as I
have never used any php web frameworks before, but I am familiar with Angular and Django,
so that will help me understand it better. In the case of composer, I have used other console tools like
node.js I will be in familiar territory.

Refreshing ones knowledge on hosting, domain names and managing a deployed site is 
always handy.

The best way to do is to build a eshop/ecommerce site to really get to know the
ins and outs of the framework and how it functions. 

The site will be live at some point for demo purposes and a link will be provided once the 
bare minimum has been setup and ready to be launched.
