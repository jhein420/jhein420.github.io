I recently decided to modernize my knowledge of php web development by trying out the
Symfony 6 PHP framework along with the doctrine ORM tools. This will be a challenge as I
have never used any php web frameworks before, but I am familiar with Angular and Django,
so that will help me understand it better. In the case of composer, I have used other console tools like
node.js I will be in familiar territory.

Refreshing ones knowledge on hosting, domain names and managing a deployed site is 
always handy. The best way to do is to start simple to really get to know the
ins and outs of the framework and how it functions. 

Documentation

Symfony 6 : https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html
Doctrine : https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/current/tutorials/getting-started.html
PHP 7 : https://www.php.net/docs.php

However, finding a good tutoial for Symfony 6 online has been a nightmare. As soon as I find a decent one
I will post it here.

Update: I have found one. A basic tutorial for a eshop and shopping cart. All credit to the original 
creators and authors.

Conclusions:
This endevour really tested my abiity to research good documentation and my skills to apply previous 
knowledge to old and new problems. 
This project can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/jhein420"> Github profile </a>. 

This is not the end. I will be starting a new project to build a new demo symfony 6 webapp ,deploy it
and have it be live.
