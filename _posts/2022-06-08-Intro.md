Welcome to my personal portfolio site!

<p>This is a place where I can show off various software and other projects
I have been working on throughout my developement journey.</p>

<p>That could be from normal web development to getting into data science, game developement, embedded 
systems developement, 3d printing and all the things inbetween.</p>

<p> Looking forward to what I will attempt next. </p>
