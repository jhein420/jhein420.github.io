I became interested in web scraping as it seemed like a fun way to challenge myself on my knowledge of
web design and exlploiting 'grey-areas' online.

So I decided to start with python and the BeautifulSoup package. I chose to follow this
tutorial here at <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-web-scraping-tutorial/'>geeksforgeeks </a>
for python and this one for <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-scrape-websites-with-node-js-and-cheerio/' > node.js </a>

One of the sites I frequently use, <a href='https://www.botshop.co.za/'> BotShop </a> was the first site that I would try my hand at.

Here is the scraper collection, some written in python and some using node.js.<br>
I called it <a href='https://github.com/jhein420/scrapey' > Scrapey. </a>.
