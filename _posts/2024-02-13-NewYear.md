Returning to GitHub in 2024

<p>
    Had to put my career on hold the past year and a half due to looking after family and my own personal issues.
    Getting laid off really threw a spanner in my routine and forced me to re-evaluate my goals and find a new way
    forward.

    I have always been the best at the waiting game.
