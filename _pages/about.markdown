Just a young software developer from South Africa looking to grow his skills 
and further his career goals.

I am a big fan of all things tech, from run of the mill web development 
all the way to game development, data science, IoT devices, 3d printing and 
embedded systems electronics.

Looking out for any opportunities to improve and grow my own skillset
in both software and hardware spheres of I.T.
