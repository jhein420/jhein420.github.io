Just a young software developer from South Africa looking to grow his skills 
and further his career goals.

I enjoy tinkering within all the different areas of tech, from run of the mill web development 
all the way to game development, data science, IoT devices, 3d printing and 
embedded systems electronics.

Finding enjoyment in creating new software applications that solve a variety of real world 
problems is a great source of accomplishment in my opinion.

On the hardware side I insist on always diagnosing and fixing my own devices, be they a
laptop,desktop or router. Being able to repair and maintain ones own computers or peripherals
is key to being a good problem solver.

Feel free to check out my github or various blog posts that detail the projects I am curently
working on.
