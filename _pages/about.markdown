Just a young software developer from South Africa looking to grow his skills 
and further his career.

I enjoy tinkering within all the different areas of tech, from run of the mill web development 
all the way to game development, data science, artificial intelligence, IoT devices, 3d printing and 
embedded systems electronics.

Creating new software applications for my own amusement is a
habit I have been trying to cultivate for years

On the hardware side I insist on always fixing my own devices. Being able to repair and maintain my own equipment
is a point of pride for me.

Feel free to check out my socials and the rest of the site.
